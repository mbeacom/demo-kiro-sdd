# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an open-source web application designed to help animal shelters efficiently manage their operations. The application will provide a comprehensive platform for managing animals, volunteers, resources, and adoptions through a modular, role-based system. Built with Next.js and Material-UI (MUI), the application will feature a secure GraphQL API and focus on three core entities: Animals, Volunteers, and Adoptions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Animal Management

**User Story:** As a shelter staff member, I want to manage animal records comprehensively, so that I can track each animal's status, medical history, and availability for adoption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a staff member adds a new animal THEN the system SHALL capture basic information (name, species, breed, age, gender, intake date)
2. WHEN a staff member updates animal medical records THEN the system SHALL store vaccination history, medical treatments, and health status
3. WHEN an animal's status changes THEN the system SHALL update availability status (available, adopted, medical hold, etc.)
4. WHEN viewing animal profiles THEN the system SHALL display photos, behavioral notes, and special needs information
5. IF an animal has special requirements THEN the system SHALL flag these prominently in the profile

### Requirement 2: Volunteer Management

**User Story:** As a shelter coordinator, I want to manage volunteer information and schedules, so that I can efficiently organize volunteer activities and track their contributions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new volunteer registers THEN the system SHALL capture contact information, availability, and skills/interests
2. WHEN scheduling volunteer activities THEN the system SHALL allow assignment of volunteers to specific tasks and time slots
3. WHEN volunteers log hours THEN the system SHALL track volunteer time and generate reports
4. WHEN volunteers have training requirements THEN the system SHALL track completion status and certifications
5. IF a volunteer has restrictions or preferences THEN the system SHALL respect these when suggesting assignments

### Requirement 3: Adoption Process Management

**User Story:** As an adoption counselor, I want to manage the adoption process from application to completion, so that I can ensure proper matches between animals and adopters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a potential adopter submits an application THEN the system SHALL capture adopter information and preferences
2. WHEN reviewing applications THEN the system SHALL allow staff to add notes and approval status
3. WHEN an adoption is approved THEN the system SHALL update animal status and create adoption records
4. WHEN processing adoption fees THEN the system SHALL track payment status and generate receipts
5. IF an adoption falls through THEN the system SHALL return the animal to available status and log the reason

### Requirement 4: Role-Based Access Control

**User Story:** As a shelter administrator, I want to control user access based on roles, so that sensitive information is protected and users only see relevant functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users log in THEN the system SHALL authenticate credentials and assign appropriate role permissions
2. WHEN staff members access features THEN the system SHALL restrict functionality based on their role (admin, staff, volunteer, viewer)
3. WHEN volunteers access the system THEN the system SHALL limit access to their assigned tasks and general animal information
4. WHEN administrators manage users THEN the system SHALL allow role assignment and permission modification
5. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt

### Requirement 5: GraphQL API Security

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a secure API that protects data integrity, so that the application remains secure and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL validate authentication tokens
2. WHEN data is queried THEN the system SHALL apply role-based filtering to results
3. WHEN mutations are performed THEN the system SHALL validate user permissions for the specific operation
4. WHEN sensitive data is accessed THEN the system SHALL log access attempts for audit purposes
5. IF invalid or malicious requests are detected THEN the system SHALL reject them and implement rate limiting

### Requirement 6: Resource Management

**User Story:** As a shelter manager, I want to track shelter resources and supplies, so that I can maintain adequate inventory and plan for needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding inventory items THEN the system SHALL track item details, quantities, and locations
2. WHEN resources are used THEN the system SHALL update inventory levels and track usage patterns
3. WHEN inventory runs low THEN the system SHALL generate alerts for reordering
4. WHEN donations are received THEN the system SHALL log donor information and item details
5. IF resources are allocated to specific animals THEN the system SHALL track these assignments

### Requirement 7: Reporting and Analytics

**User Story:** As a shelter director, I want to generate reports on shelter operations, so that I can make informed decisions and meet reporting requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating adoption reports THEN the system SHALL provide statistics on adoption rates, times to adoption, and outcomes
2. WHEN creating volunteer reports THEN the system SHALL show volunteer hours, participation rates, and activity summaries
3. WHEN reviewing animal statistics THEN the system SHALL display intake numbers, medical costs, and length of stay data
4. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL provide reports in multiple formats (PDF, CSV, Excel)
5. IF custom date ranges are selected THEN the system SHALL filter all report data accordingly

### Requirement 8: User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As any system user, I want an intuitive and responsive interface, so that I can efficiently complete my tasks regardless of device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive design that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
2. WHEN navigating the interface THEN the system SHALL use Material-UI components for consistent design and accessibility
3. WHEN performing common tasks THEN the system SHALL provide shortcuts and bulk operations where appropriate
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear, actionable error messages
5. IF users need help THEN the system SHALL provide contextual help and documentation links
